##Don't understand this but apparently this is the also good 
##see pepcoding video for GCD and LCM lecture 27
## this is valid because it does not matter if you do modulo of smaller by larger or larger my smaller (24,36) (x,y)
# because when you do smaller by larger it gives remainder as smaller number [x%y 24%36 = 24]
# now one number is larger number and other is the remainder[modulo value y=24 ] which is the smaller number 
# now the module will repeat it self.. but now it's swapped so (36,24) [36%24 == 12] (12, 24)
